### How to Contribute

We regularly add new tasks to [projects](https://github.com/orgs/afet-yonetim-sistemi/projects/5) area. You can assign one of them to yourself and start the development. **Before development**, you should check [our product repository](https://github.com/afet-yonetim-sistemi/ays-product/tree/main/doc/mobile) to get analysis of the task. You can also access olders. **After development**, there are some rules while reviewing any pull request process, please pay attention to them.

#### Rules
- Each branch name should be **{label}/{meaningful-shortcut-of-taskname-with-dash}** (Example given: feature/updating-readme)

- Each commit message should be **{taskname: commit message}** (Example given: Updating README as Contributor-friendly: Add readme etc.)

- Each pull request should contain screenshot of your task content like a mock up, figma design etc.. You should copy and paste it as an image. It provides reviewing better.

- You can track all pull requesting, merging operations via our Discord named **#ios-github-pr** channel.

- Each development needs the documentation. Please write the documentation blocks of your code blocks. We run Jazzy for the documentation.
